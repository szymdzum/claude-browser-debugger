# Workflow Guide (Superseded)

This document has been superseded by [`docs/guides/workflows.md`](workflows.md), which covers the current Python CLI (`python3 -m scripts.cdp.cli.main`).

If you encounter any references to legacy Bash commands or collector scripts, please consult `docs/guides/workflows.md` for the up-to-date instructions.
